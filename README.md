# Son Of War Mod
 A content mod for Unciv that takes a turn towards fantasy.

Current Features:
- Eighteen unique civilizations, each with its own unique units, buildings, and strategy. This is a fully separate gameplay experience from the standard Uniciv, due to a complete override of the default nations.
- Eleven unique city-states, each with thematic nation effects as well as unique units / buildings. These unique buildings are never destroyed when capturing their city, so you can also get them by taking the city-states that build them.
- New units, such as the buildable "Herald" unit that can start a golden age when expended, and an expensive (for its era) War Elephant unit that is great for dealing with early-game melee units.
- New unit types, including Fliers (similar to Helicopters), Bestial units, and Heroes.
- In-world Wonder replacements up to the Medieval era, all of which are scaled up in usefulness and cost.
- Many reworks for vanilla features. For example, the vanilla Colosseum (now called "Arena") provides a small experience boost to newly produced units in addition to its vanilla functionality.
- There's a lot more not listed here, I've spent many years on this mod, and admittedly I have done a very poor job on the documentation. This does however mean that there are quite a few features you can discover on your own.
- Reworks to Religion - this is a world with real gods, not just faith!

Planned Features:
- Many more civilizations (I have some planned for most eras).
- More buildings.
- Tech tree overhaul. (Next update most likely)
- Magical tech-tree path. (Next update most likely)
- In-world Wonder replacements for Medieval era and later. (Next update most likely)
- Further reworks to Religion.

Suggestions are welcome, although the worldbuilding aspects (such as nations and their units) have already been designed after being used for another game. This does in fact mean the lore is pre-established.
